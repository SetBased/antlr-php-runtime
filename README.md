This repository is a fork of [antlr-php-runtime](https://github.com/antlr/antlr-php-runtime). The (hopefully short-lived) mission of  this repository is to release an ANTLR runtime library for PHP 8.x.

Install this package with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org):
```
composer require SetBased/antlr4-php-runtime
```
